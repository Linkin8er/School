/** Program Requirements:
 * Program a plotter using CSVs
 * Pick a formula/function you like
 *  Write a program that plots the output as CSV
 * Pick a function
 *  Picking starting and ending values
 *  Plug those in for a y value
 *  Store x and y
 * Use any file exporting technique from your past or the internet. (Cite if not freehanding it) to export your data.csv
 * Make sure program can accept parameters for the range to use
 * (don't make it open excel immediately)
Open in Excel and create a graph
Collect samples of outputs in excel charts for showing different configs. 
Make a salter(add random data) and smoother
Salter
Add random amounts to each y value from some configurable range
Needs a large number of data points
Test multiple different times in different ways
Smoother
Replace each data point with the average of K nearest neighbors. 
Allow user to determine k
Graph
Report on results, use figures, screenshots, whatever needed
Consider ways to make them better
